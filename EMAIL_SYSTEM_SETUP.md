# 📧 Order Confirmation Email System

## ✅ **System Status: FULLY IMPLEMENTED**

The order confirmation email system is **already working** and automatically sends emails when customers make purchases using Nodemailer and Gmail.

## 🎯 **What Happens When Someone Buys Something**

### **Automatic Email Flow:**
1. **Customer completes purchase** → Stripe payment succeeds
2. **Order is saved** → `/api/save-order` endpoint processes the order
3. **Emails are sent automatically** → Both customer and admin receive notifications
4. **Customer gets confirmation** → Professional email with order details
5. **Admin gets notification** → Email with order info and admin dashboard link

## 📧 **Email Templates**

### **Customer Confirmation Email:**
- **Design:** Matches contact form styling with orange theme
- **Content:** Order details, items, shipping address, next steps
- **Styling:** Professional HTML template with All Levels Athletics branding
- **Subject:** `Order Confirmation - ORD-000001`

### **Admin Notification Email:**
- **Design:** Same professional styling as customer email
- **Content:** Customer info, order details, shipping address, action required
- **Features:** Direct link to admin dashboard
- **Subject:** `New Order Received - ORD-000001`

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Files Involved:**
- `app/api/send-order-confirmation/route.ts` - Main email sending logic
- `app/api/save-order/route.ts` - Triggers email sending after order save
- `app/success/page.tsx` - Initiates order saving process

### **Email Configuration:**
- **Service:** Nodemailer with Gmail SMTP
- **Authentication:** Gmail App Password (secure)
- **Templates:** HTML + Text versions for all emails
- **Error Handling:** Graceful failure (order still saves if email fails)

## ⚙️ **Environment Variables Required**

Add these to your `.env.local` file:

```env
# SMTP Configuration (Gmail)
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_SECURE=false
SMTP_USER=your-email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASS=your-app-password
